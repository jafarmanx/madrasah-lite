[![surah-al-ikhlas ](./images/surah-al-ikhlas.png)](https://quran.com/112)

 > "Say, He is Allah the One. Allah the Eternal. He does not beget nor is he begotten. And there is nothing like him"

- **Allah is ONE!**
    - *Surah Al-Ikhlas (112) summarizses this*
- **He is the Only One Worthy of Worship**
    - Muslims pray, ask for help, and rely only on Allah.
    - Worshipping others besides Him (like idols, saints, or the dead) is called shirk, the worst sin in Islam.

- **He Has Beautiful Names and Perfect Attributes**
    - üåü Ar-Rahmaan ‚Äì The Most Merciful
        - Allah is very, very kind and loving to everyone ‚Äî even if they don‚Äôt ask or don‚Äôt thank Him
        - üóØÔ∏èImagine this: 
            - When you're sleeping, Allah still gives you air to breathe.
            - When you're playing, He gives you the sun, your eyes to see, and your heart to feel joy.
        - It‚Äôs like when your mom or dad takes care of you all the time ‚Äî even when you don‚Äôt say thank you ‚Äî but even more! That‚Äôs Ar-Rahmaan.
    - üåü Al-‚ÄòAleem ‚Äì The All-Knowing
        - Allah knows everything ‚Äî every little thing you do, think, or feel.
        - üóØÔ∏èImagine this:
            - Even if you whisper something, or just think it in your head, Allah knows it.
            - If a tiny ant is walking in the dark under a rock‚Ä¶ Allah knows that too!
    - üåü Al-KhƒÅliq ‚Äì The Creator
        - Allah is the One who made everything ‚Äî from the stars in the sky to the tiny bugs on the ground
        - üóØÔ∏èImagine this:
            - When you draw a picture, you make something ‚Äî but Allah made real people, animals, trees, and planets from nothing at all!
            - He didn‚Äôt need tools or help. He just says ‚ÄúBe!‚Äù and it happens. 
    - and many more.
    - We learn about Him through His names and what He tells us in the Qur‚Äôan and Sunnah.

- **He Created Everything and Controls Everything**
    - üå≥ Allah created the heavens, the earth, and all living beings.
    - üå∏ Nothing happens except by His will.
