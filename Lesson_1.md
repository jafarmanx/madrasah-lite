[![surah-al-ikhlas ](./images/surah-al-ikhlas.png)](https://quran.com/112)

 > "Say, He is Allah the One. Allah the Eternal. He does not beget nor is he begotten. And there is nothing like him"

- **Allah is ONE!**
    - *Surah Al-Ikhlas (112) summarizses this*
- **He is the Only One Worthy of Worship**
    - Muslims pray, ask for help, and rely only on Allah.
    - Worshipping others besides Him (like idols, saints, or the dead) is called shirk, the worst sin in Islam.

- **He Has Beautiful Names and Perfect Attributes**
    - 🌟 Ar-Rahmaan – The Most Merciful
        - Ar-Rahmaan means Allah is very, very kind and loving to everyone — even if they don’t ask or don’t thank Him
        - Imagine this: 
            - When you're sleeping, Allah still gives you air to breathe.
            - When you're playing, He gives you the sun, your eyes to see, and your heart to feel joy.
        - It’s like when your mom or dad takes care of you all the time — even when you don’t say thank you — but even more! That’s Ar-Rahmaan.
    - 🌟 Al-‘Aleem – The All-Knowing
        - Al-‘Aleem means Allah knows everything — every little thing you do, think, or feel.
        - Imagine this:
            - Even if you whisper something, or just think it in your head, Allah knows it.
            - If a tiny ant is walking in the dark under a rock… Allah knows that too!
    - 🌟 Al-Khāliq – The Creator
        - Al-Khāliq means Allah is the One who made everything — from the stars in the sky to the tiny bugs on the ground
        - Imagine this:
            - When you draw a picture, you make something — but Allah made real people, animals, trees, and planets from nothing at all!
            - He didn’t need tools or help. He just says “Be!” and it happens. 
    - and many more.
    - We learn about Him through His names and what He tells us in the Qur’an and Sunnah.

- **He Created Everything and Controls Everything**
    - Allah created the heavens, the earth, and all living beings.
    - Nothing happens except by His will.
