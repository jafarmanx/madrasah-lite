Overview:
- **Allah is ONE!**
---------------------------------------
-- Surah Al-Ikhlas (112) summarizses this:
-- ![surah-al-ikhlas](./images/surah-al-ikhlas.png)(https://quran.com/112)
 > "Say: He is Allah the One. Allah the Eternal. He does not beget nor is he begotten. And there is nothing like him"
----------------------------------------
- **He is the Only One Worthy of Worship**
-- Muslims pray, ask for help, and rely only on Allah.
-- Worshipping others besides Him (like idols, saints, or the dead) is called shirk, the worst sin in Islam.

- **He Has Beautiful Names and Perfect Attributes**
-- Allah is Ar-Rahman (Most Merciful), 
-- Al-Aleem (All-Knowing), 
-- Al-Khaliq (The Creator), and many more.
-- We learn about Him through His names and what He tells us in the Qur’an and Sunnah.

- **He Created Everything and Controls Everything**
-- Allah created the heavens, the earth, and all living beings.
-- Nothing happens except by His will.
