# ðŸ“˜ Outline: *Praiseworthy & Blameworthy Knowledge*  
**Based on Chapter 2 of Ihya Ulum al-Din by Imam Al-Ghazali**  
*For Ages 7â€“10 | Simplified Teaching Points*

---

## 1. **Obligatory Knowledge for Every Muslim**
- Every Muslim must learn what they need to perform their duties, like salah, fasting, and purification.
- This includes both belief (Aqeedah) and essential practices â€” tailored to each person's daily needs.

---

## 2. **Knowledge That Is a Collective Duty**
- Some knowledge (like medicine, farming, arithmetic) is essential for society but not for each person.
- If enough people know it, the obligation is lifted from the rest â€” otherwise, it becomes a communal sin.

---

## 3. **Divisions of Knowledge**
- Knowledge is divided into legal (revealed) and non-legal (worldly); each has subtypes.
- Legal knowledge comes from revelation; non-legal includes math, science, and other worldly skills.

---

## 4. **Praiseworthy Knowledge**
- Any knowledge that brings one closer to Allah, like learning about worship and inner purification, is noble.
- The best knowledge is that which changes the heart and helps the person grow spiritually.

---

## 5. **Blameworthy Knowledge**
- Knowledge is blameworthy when it harms others, wastes time, or fuels pride â€” like magic, astrology, or useless arguments.
- Even if technically accurate, itâ€™s bad if it distracts from Allah or causes harm.

---

## 6. **Permissible but Neutral Knowledge**
- Some types of knowledge, like poetry and history, are neither good nor bad unless misused.
- If used well, they support understanding or character; if used wrongly, they distract or corrupt.

---

## 7. **Balance Between Outward and Inward Knowledge**
- Outward actions like salah must be paired with inner purification like humility and sincerity.
- A person must care for their heart as much as their limbs in worship â€” both are part of Islam.

---

## 8. **Avoiding Useless Learning**
- One must not dive into knowledge that doesn't benefit the Hereafter or serve a present need.
- Learning for fame, debate, or pride is a trap â€” itâ€™s better to know little with sincerity than much with ego.
