# ðŸ“˜ Outline: *Knowledge Without Action*  
**Based on Chapter 5 of Ihya Ulum al-Din by Imam Al-Ghazali**  
*For Ages 7â€“10 | Simplified Teaching Points*

---

## 1. **The Hypocrisy of Speaking Without Acting**
- Many talk about good, but donâ€™t do it themselves.
- True knowledge must lead to action â€” not just words.

---

## 2. **Warnings from Prophets and Companions**
- Prophets like Isa (AS) warned of scholars who donâ€™t follow what they teach.
- The companions stressed that knowledge without action brings no benefit.

---

## 3. **The Scholar Who Doesnâ€™t Practice Is in Danger**
- Teaching others while ignoring your own actions is like a sick doctor treating patients.
- It harms both the scholar and those who follow him.

---

## 4. **Seeking Knowledge for the Dunya**
- Some people study just to gain status, wealth, or praise.
- This kind of learning brings punishment, not reward.

---

## 5. **Misguided Scholars Give Bad Examples**
- They preach piety but chase after rich people and ignore the needy.
- Their actions show their real goal: worldly gain.

---

## 6. **The Devilâ€™s Trap of Endless Learning**
- Shaytan encourages learning only to delay acting on it.
- This turns the student into someone who knows a lot but obeys little.

---

## 7. **Knowledge Is a Tool for Action**
- Knowledge should guide our heart and hands toward good.
- If it doesnâ€™t lead to better behavior, itâ€™s wasted.

---

## 8. **Small Deeds with Sincerity Are Greater**
- Two sincere rakâ€˜ahs are better than years of study without action.
- On the Day of Judgment, Allah will ask how we used what we knew.

---

## 9. **Final Reminder**
- The best people are those who know and act for the sake of Allah.
- Real success is not in knowing a lot, but in doing what pleases Allah.
