## 2. **Real Knowledge Leads to Fear of Allah**
- Knowing more should make us more humble and careful.
- If someone becomes arrogant with knowledge, they’ve missed its purpose.

## 3. **Practice Before Learning More**
- Don’t rush to learn more without using what you already know.
- Acting on what you’ve learned helps you grow in the right way.
