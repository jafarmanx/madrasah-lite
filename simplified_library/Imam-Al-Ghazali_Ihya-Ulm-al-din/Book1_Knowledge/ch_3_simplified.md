**Based on Chapter 3 of Ihya Ulum al-Din by Imam Al-Ghazali**  
*For Ages 7â€“10 | Simplified Teaching Points*

---

## 1. **Not All Knowledge Is Good**
- Just because something is called "knowledge" doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s beneficial.
- Harmful knowledge â€” even if accurate â€” can still be dangerous if misused.

---

## 2. **Three Reasons Knowledge Becomes Blameworthy**
- It causes harm to others (like magic).
- It harms the learner spiritually or distracts from the afterlife.
- It wastes time or leads to arrogance, pride, or useless debates.

---

## 3. **Changing the Names of Sciences**
- Some people renamed blameworthy sciences with good titles to mislead others.
- Terms like *Fiqh*, *Ilm*, and *Hikmah* were once noble but have been twisted in meaning.

---

## 4. **True Meaning of Islamic Terms**
- Originally, *Fiqh* meant knowing the path to Allah, not just legal technicalities.
- Real *Ilm* and *Tawheed* connect the heart to Allah, not just theory or debate.

---

## 5. **Misuse of Religious Knowledge**
- Even Islamic sciences can become harmful if they're used for showing off or arguing.
- Scholars must guard their intentions and seek sincerity in all learning.

---

## 6. **What to Learn and How Much**
- Some sciences are good in moderation, but harmful in excess or obsession.
- Learn what you need for worship and salvation â€” donâ€™t drown in debates or trivia.

---

## 7. **True Wisdom and Knowledge**
- Real wisdom helps us grow closer to Allah and avoid the traps of the ego.
- Knowledge should be a light in the heart â€” not just facts in the head.

---

## 8. **Be a Seeker with Purpose**
- Focus on purifying your heart before correcting others.
- Don't learn just to be praised â€” learn to change yourself and serve your Lord.
